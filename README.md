simple program that checks the ACTUAL loc in a program( i was jsut annoyed at seeing some projects that were like 1k loc just for half of them to be blank or comments(yes,i am petty like that))
P.S it takes as input one file as cli, the program WILL tell you if you do something wrong. It also only accepts python programs
